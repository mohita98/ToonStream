# ToonStream
ToonStream is a project that I have been working on that involves developing an online platform that allows users to stream cartoons and animated content from various sources. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access their favorite animated content on-demand.

In this project, I was responsible for the design and development of the platform's front-end functionalities. I used my expertise in web development to create a easy-to-use interface that integrates with various streaming services.

ToonStream allows users to search for cartoons based on various criteria such as genre, age rating, and popularity. The platform also provides recommendations based on the user's viewing history and preferences.
